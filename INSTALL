lspf - ISPF clone for linux systems

Requirements:
gcc 
ncurses 
boost 
oorexx
file


Boost and ncurses required to compile: 
    - lspf.cpp

OOREXX required for: 
    - POREXX1.cpp - module for writing lspf applications in REXX 
    - PEDRXM1.cpp - edit macro module for writing edit macros in REXX

file required for:
    - PBRO01A.cpp, as it is linked with -lmagic

To install:

There are compilation scripts included in the source tree for compiling all
of the different peices of this software. 
    - compsetup compiles setup.cpp
    - comp1 compiles lspf.cpp
    - compapps compiles all of the SPF applications in the src/Apps directory

1)  Customise lspf.h  Make sure paths ZSPROF, ZUPROF, MLIB etc exist.

2)  Compile and run setup.cpp to create the default ISPSPROF profile member,
    ISPCMDS and USRCMDS command tables.

3)  Compile lspf.cpp

4)  Compile applications

5)  Copy directories mlib, plib and tlib to the paths defined in MLIB, PLIB and
    TLIB in lspf.h if different. If using keylists, make sure key table file
    ISRKEYP in the tlib/ directory is in the ZUPROF directory (usually ~/.lspf/)

This has been developed on Arch Linux - link options may vary (eg. if ncurses
is built with --with-termlib add -ltinfo )


Run lspf in a terminal

Known to work with:
gcc 7.2.1
ncurses 6.0
boost 1.65.1
